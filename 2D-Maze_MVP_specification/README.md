The Maze 2D Most Viable Product (MVP)

## Raycasting with SDL2 and C

This is a raycasting demo written in c using the SDL2 library for drawing. 
In the main demo the controls are fairly simple:
* WASD to move arround
* QE to turn the player

In the level editor its also fairly simple, just click where you want the line to start and where you want the line to end. Also a quick tip is to overlap the end of lines as a 1 pixel gap can look very large due to the low resolution.

### Instalation
I will use SDL2, gcc and makefile to achieve the purpose of building the 2D Maze Game. To install these for your OS i suggest looking for a guide as these are just general purpose good tools.
