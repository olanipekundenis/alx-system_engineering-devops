ALX Command line for the win

A wonderful interactive sandbox for mastering linux commands

STEP 1

I clicked on CMD CHALLENGE which is the link provided on the project. It 
took me to the the Command Challenges website, where I began to answer
all the questions

STEP 2

I took a snapshot and save every answered questions into the folder I've
earlier created named command_line_for_the_win

STEP 3

I hence used SFTP to put the whole folder into the intranet sandbox

STEP 4

Finally I cloned the repo of alx-system_engineering_devops into the 
sandbox and further provided the steps I used via a README.md file

STEP 5

In conclusion I further push it to the github repo
